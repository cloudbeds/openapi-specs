# Cloudbeds OpenAPI specs
Welcome to the repository for the latest OpenAPI specs for the Cloudbeds API's.  This is a compliment to the
developer documentation at https://developers.cloudbeds.com which has guides and tutorials as well as API documentation
built from the same OpenAPI specs found in this repository.

We have a Python SDK that is auto-generated from these docs, you can find it 
at https://github.com/cloudbeds/cloudbeds-api-python.  

There are tools to generate similar API client SDK's for most popular languages from OpenAPI specs, our hope
is you find the specs here useful for generating your own API client if needed as well 
as just browsing in your favorite OpenAPI spec viewer.
